# Nayaya.ai — Generative AI for Demystifying Legal Documents

![Flow Diagram](./Flwo.jpg)

## 🚀 Vision

Nayaya.ai makes complex legal documents — rental agreements, loan contracts, employment offers, and online Terms of Service — easy to understand. Built on **Google Cloud AI (Document AI, Vertex AI, Gemini, Matching Engine)**, it converts dense clauses into plain-language explanations, highlights hidden risks, and answers "what-if" questions.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Nayaya.ai is an educational tool to simplify legal text. It does *not* provide legal advice. Please consult a qualified lawyer for decisions with legal consequences.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adit-Jain-srm/Nayaya.ai.git
   cd Nayaya.ai
   
   # On Unix/macOS:
   chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   
   # On Windows:
   bash scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **The setup script will:**
   - Enable required Google Cloud APIs
   - Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
   - Build and deploy applications to Cloud Run
   - Configure authentication and permissions

### Local Development

1. **Setup local environment:**
   ```bash
   # On Unix/macOS:
   chmod +x scripts/local-dev.sh
   ./scripts/local-dev.sh setup
   
   # On Windows:
   bash scripts/local-dev.sh setup
   ```

2. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/local-dev.sh start
   ```

   This starts:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`
   - API Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Manual Setup

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Sample Documents

Use the provided sample in `samples/rental-agreement.md` to test the system:

1. Convert the markdown to PDF
2. Upload through the web interface
3. Watch the processing pipeline:
   - Document AI extracts text and structure
   - Vertex AI classifies clauses and assesses risks
   - Gemini generates plain-language explanations
   - RAG system enables Q&A functionality

### Expected Results

The sample rental agreement contains several high-risk clauses that should be flagged:
- Excessive security deposit forfeiture
- Unlimited rent increases
- Broad indemnification clauses
- Restrictive termination penalties
